Based on the centralized SaaS architecture we just designed, the cost structure is incredibly efficient because the heavy lifting (inference) is done on the client's hardware, not your
  cloud.

  Here is the breakdown of your operational costs:

  1. The Marginal Cost (Cost to add "One More Client")
  This is the direct cost incurred for every new hub you deploy.
  Estimated Cost: $1.50 - $3.00 per month

   * Compute (Inference): $0.00 (Runs on Client's Edge/Jetson).
   * Storage (Images): ~$0.10 (Only "Failed/Alert" images are uploaded. Assuming 5GB/mo per client @ $0.02/GB).
   * Database (Metadata): ~$0.05 (Text rows for logs/heartbeats are tiny).
   * Bandwidth (Egress): ~$0.50 (Docker updates + Image viewing).
   * Notifications (SendGrid/Twilio): ~$1.00 (Variable based on alert volume).

  2. The "Keep the Lights On" Cost (Base Platform)
  This is your fixed monthly cost to have the Azure environment running, whether you have 1 client or 50.


  ┌────────────────────┬─────────────────────────────────────┬─────────────────┐
  │ Component          │ Service Tier                        │ Monthly Cost    │
  ├────────────────────┼─────────────────────────────────────┼─────────────────┤
  │ Database           │ Postgres Flexible (B1ms)            │ ~$25.00         │
  │ Backend API        │ Container Apps (0.5 vCPU / 1GB RAM) │ ~$25.00         │
  │ Frontend           │ Static Web Apps (Standard)          │ $9.00           │
  │ Message Bus        │ Service Bus (Standard)              │ $10.00          │
  │ Container Registry │ ACR (Basic)                         │ $5.00           │
  │ Total Fixed Cost   │                                     │ ~$74.00 / month │
  └────────────────────┴─────────────────────────────────────┴─────────────────┘


  Note: If your existing APIM is on the "Consumption" tier, it adds $0 fixed cost. If it's "Developer" or "Basic," add ~$48 or ~$147 to this base.

  3. Total Cost Analysis (Scale Scenarios)
  The more clients you add, the cheaper it gets per client (economies of scale).

   * With 1 Client:
       * Fixed ($74) + Variable ($2) = $76.00 / month (effectively $76/client).
   * With 10 Clients:
       * Fixed ($74) + Variable ($20) = $94.00 / month ($9.40/client).
   * With 100 Clients:
       * Fixed ($74) + Scale-up API ($25) + Variable ($200) = $299.00 / month ($2.99/client).

  Summary
  Because you have moved the expensive GPU compute to the Edge, your cloud footprint is essentially just a management dashboard and storage locker.

  Your break-even point is extremely low. If you charge a client $20/month for the service:
   * You cover your entire Azure bill with just 4 clients.
   * Every client after #4 is 90% profit margin.
