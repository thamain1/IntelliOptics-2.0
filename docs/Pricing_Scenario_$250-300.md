## Recommendation: Tiered Pricing vs Flat Rate

### Option 1: Flat Rate at $300/month (Simplest)

**Positioning:** "Unlimited AI Detection for $300/month"

**Pros:**

- No usage tracking needed
- Excellent margins on most clients (90%+)
- Predictable for both you and client

**Cons:**
- Leaves money on table for enterprise
- May be too high for very small deployments (1-2 cameras)

**Who this works for:**
- Early stage (first 20-30 clients)
- Want simple pricing
- Focus on mid-market clients (10-50 cameras)

---

### Option 2: Two-Tier Model

**Tier 1: Standard - $250/month**
- Up to 10 edge hubs
- Up to 50 cameras
- Up to 50,000 queries/month

**Tier 2: Enterprise - $750-$1,500/month**

---

## My Recommendation: Start with Flat $300/month

### Why Start Simple

**For your first 20-30 clients:**
1. **Learn customer usage patterns** - See what "typical" really looks like
2. **Validate pricing** - Is $300 too high? Too low?
3. **Focus on product** - Not pricing optimization
4. **Easy to sell** - "Flat $300, unlimited"
5. **Minimize churn** - No surprise bills

**Margins are excellent (90-95%)** - You can afford to keep it simple

### When to Add Tiers

**After 20-30 clients, consider adding:**

1. **"Starter" tier at $149** - Capture smaller customers you're currently losing
2. **"Enterprise" tier at $1,500+** - Monetize heavy users who would pay more

**Evidence you need tiers:**
- Losing deals because "$300 is too much for 5 cameras"
- Enterprise clients with 100+ cameras getting steal at $300
- Clients asking "what if we go over the limit?"

## Pricing Psychology

### $250 vs $275 vs $300

**$250:**
- Feels like "quarter" pricing
- Nice round number
- Safe, conservative

**$275:**
- Odd number can signal precision
- "Not quite $300"
- 10% buffer over $250

**$300:**
- Premium positioning
- Clean, simple number
- Signals quality

**My pick: $300**
- Clean number
- Room to discount to $250-275 and still have margin
- Can offer annual discount ($3,000/year = $250/month)

---

## Annual Pricing Strategy

### Offer Annual Discount

**Monthly: $300/month** = $3,600/year
**Annual: $3,000/year** = $250/month (17% discount)

**Benefits:**
- Locks in clients for 12 months (reduces churn)
- Improves cash flow
- Still 90%+ margins
- Standard SaaS practice (20% discount for annual)

**Suggested Annual Pricing:**
- Pay monthly: $300/month ($3,600/year)
- Pay annually: $3,000/year (save $600)

## Summary: Margins at $250-$300/month

| Price Point | Typical Client Blended Margin | Enterprise Margin | Overall Assessment |
|-------------|-------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **$250/month** | 90-95% | 56% | Excellent, but tight on enterprise |
| **$275/month** | 91-96% | 60% | Sweet spot for single-tier |
| **$300/month** | 92-96% | 63% | Best margins, room to discount |

**Bottom Line:**
- **All three price points deliver 90%+ margins on typical clients**
- **$300/month recommended** for clean pricing and discount flexibility
- **Enterprise clients (200k+ queries) should be custom priced** at $1,000-$2,500/month
- **Edge-first architecture makes this incredibly profitable** at any of these price points

---

**Next Steps:**
